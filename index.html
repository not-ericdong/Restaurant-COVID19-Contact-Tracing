         Hello! 
      </p>
      <!-- This site is currently under construction.
         I am hosting this on AWS and using Cloudfront which makes it slightly more difficult to test my website responsivly, so I am putting this page here temporarly.
         I am working on my 
         <a href='https://github.com/not-ericdong/Restaurant-COVID19-Contact-Tracing/blob/master/README.md'>third project</a></p> along side this website both of which should be completed by the end of September 2020!
         Thanks for visiting! -->

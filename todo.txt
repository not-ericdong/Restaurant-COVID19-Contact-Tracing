covid ct app

create unique QR code for each restraunt (idk if one or many unique QRs)

use url flags store data into it
like youtube.com/watch?= .....

somehow need to auto input location ^^^^


user scans qr code - enters their number and maybe name-prob dont need for privcy
check if number enter is valid (syntax wise dont call them lol)

when entered submit into db - need: number, date, time, place

if user gets covid they go to a diff page to report
they enter their number
db looks for the number entered and find all instances
either just alert restraunt or if i can figure out how to text people for cheap
alerts other numbers based on time, place


maybe make a restraunt portal


entries older than a certain date can be deleted

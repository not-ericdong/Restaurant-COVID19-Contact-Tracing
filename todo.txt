covid ct app

create unique QR code for each restraunt (idk if one or many unique QRs)






if user gets covid they go to a diff page to report
they enter their number
db looks for the number entered and find all instances
either just alert restraunt or if i can figure out how to text people for cheap
alerts other numbers based on time, place


maybe make a restraunt portal


entries older than a certain date can be deleted



The customer will scan a unique QR code that was generated by the restaurant or small business through the website. The website will only ask for an email address from the customer. Once the customer submits an email address the email address along with the place they are visiting and the current date and time will be inserted into a database. The location is automatically created based on which QR code was scanned, the date and time is also automattically generated.

If a customer has a positive COVID-19 diagnosis they will report to the website on the Report page. Then emails will be automatically be sent out to other customers based on the time and all of the visited locations of the user with the positive case. The email contents will only specify that there has been a confirmed cased at X location from X time. Also to alert other indivisuals you have dined with.

Restraunts will need to signup on the For Businesses page, they will enter the location of their business and the name of the business. They will then be provided with an unique QR code for customers to scan.

               This website will alert you of any possible exposure you may have had to COVID-19 while being in public areas. This includes restaurants, shopping malls, local businesses, and other establishments. 
            </p>

            <p>
               Each participating establishment will obtain a unique QR code that customers can scan upon entering the premises. If a customer or worker reports that they have contracted COVID-19, the system will automatically trace the history of locations and times in each establishment that the infected individual has been in. All other customers that have been in the premises at the same time of the infected individual in the past will be notified through email that they could have possibly been exposed to the virus.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Please provide the email that you wish to receive any possible exposure notifications below. If you have used this webpage previously, please use the same email.</b>
